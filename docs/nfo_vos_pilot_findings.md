# NFO VOS pilot: what worked (2026-10-05)

Pilot: seq1 segments 4–5, 21 starts, 51-frame windows, pseudo-GT at 224 (spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-nfo-vos-benchmark-pilot-design.md`, rev. 4). Two segments: all
numbers descriptive.

## The benchmark protocol works and the baselines are not straw men
- DAVIS-style headline (frames t₀+1…t₀+49), init failure rate (J(t₀) < 0.5), VOTS DRE/NRE, LaSOT
  P_norm, frame-fixed-effects init model. Scoring at 224 vs native changes J by median 0.006
  (621 real mask pairs, r = 0.999).
- B0 (SAM2.1 b+) J&F 0.779, 5/21 init failures; T1 (SAMURAI) 0.773, 5/21: motion-aware memory does
  not fix fragmented occlusion. B0's failures are at the prompted frame itself (same prompt → same
  t₀ mask for B0/T1), not propagation drift; after a good start it recovers from brief losses
  within ≤ 3 frames.

## Integration helps AMODAL extent, not modal masks
- Amodal box IoU vs the human `groundtruth.txt` boxes (frames t₀+1…t₀+49):
  integrated blob union (tracker alignment, 7 consecutive frames, no SAM2, ~3 ms/frame) 0.652 vs
  frame-t blob box 0.546; vs the frame-t box optimally enlarged (best-of-grid, favours control)
  0.558 → **+0.094, 17/21 starts**. Oracle alignment adds only +0.004 → the tracker's alignment is
  not the bottleneck for this task.
- Versus B0's modal box optimally enlarged (1.3× width): +0.014, 8/21 → a tie with SAM2 video at
  a fraction of the compute.
- Why (derived): integration recovers person pixels visible at t−k but occluded at t (A∖V_t).
  That is exactly amodal extent, and exactly what modal GT penalises.

## Next (cheapest first)
1. Decide the benchmark's question: modal VOS (B0 strong, integration does not help) vs amodal
   person extent/localisation (integration helps; scored on human boxes, so no pseudo-GT bias;
   matches the original NFO-UNet localisation task).
2. If amodal: proper amodal baselines (an amodal VOS / amodal completion method), not enlarged
   modal boxes; then the feature-fusion SAM2 variant targets amodal extent.
3. Native resolution only matters for the SAM2-input asymmetry (T4 init failures 10/21 at 224
   vs B0 5/21 at native); the integration mechanism is scale-invariant (w/δ).
